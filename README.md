# SE320_Final

1. (10 points) Write a server program and a client program. The client sends the weight
and height for a person to the server. The server computes BMI (Body Mass Index) and
sends back to the client a string that reports the BMI. You can use the following formula
for computing BMI:
 bmi = weightInKilograms / (heightInMeters * heightInMeters)

2. (10 points) Revise the server program in Question-1 using threads to allow multiple
clients.

3. (5 points) Implement the following generic method for linear search (return the first
index value if the key is found in the list, return -1 otherwise).
public static <E extends Comparable<E>>
int linearSearch(E[] list, E key)
You can use the following code skeleton for the implementation and testing of your
code.
public class Question3 {
 public static <E extends Comparable<E>> int linearSearch(E[] list, E
key) {
 //INSERT YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE
 }

 public static void main(String[] args) {
 Integer[] list = {3, 4, 5, 1, -3, -5, -1};
 System.out.println(linearSearch(list, 2));
 System.out.println(linearSearch(list, 5));
 }
}
